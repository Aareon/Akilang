# What's next?

This is a short list of things I'm going to be working on, in rough order of attempt.

* Some form of tracing of object scopes, so that heap allocated objects can be passed freely around and deallocated intelligently. (*In progress.*)

* Methods for dynamically allocating and manipulating strings. Right now all strings are statically allocated as globals at runtime. (*In progress.*)

* Adding class methods, for things like adding length-getting, slice-getting, iteration, and other common properties. (*Extremely basic version implemented.*)

[Everything after that](mvp.md) is too far down the road to talk about, but I am at least thinking about it.
